A challenge that met the following criteria:

Searching for a city provides the user with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history and allows them to view current weather conditions for that city.

This includes the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
The UV index is color coded based on whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

The user can also see future weather conditions for that city with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

The search history pops up in the left column and the user is able to click on each city to once again view the information.
